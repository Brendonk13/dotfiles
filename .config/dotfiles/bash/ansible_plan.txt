Bugs:
    make it always set TERM=vt100 when coming from ssh !!!
    -- even xterm-kitty didnt work over ssh for test@192.168.0.30



Undecided:
    what to do with programs/ripgrep/hidden/common/.ripgreprc
    -- and the j2 file in templates/alias/***

    - maybe the vars always get sent to minimal by generate.sh -- minimals job is to always copy file in dotfiles_sources etc
    - then have if statement for the diff dotfile used by dev and above roles


    - how to handle initial config bare repo setup
    - and when to config pull


    Other desktop programs:
        - only have things for which a j2 file is needed like polybar
        - other stuff can be handled by config pull setup
            ----> do this as first step in desktop setup
            -- but how to do without overwriting files



# then test with common role etc
# then make it automatically install programs

Next:
    create file handling the bash_dotfiles_root template
    create file which does everything all at once

    Add file for downloading all my packages


    - how to handle copying bashrc without fasd ??
    - maybe just store a diff bashrc without fasd stuff
        - and role<dev will copy this bashrc
        - and role >= dev will copy my current with fasd bashrc


Noticed conditional bugs:
    fzf looks weird when TERM=vt100



# needs verification:
    - copy_bashrc.yml is actually idempotent


add function to copy a file to correct dir in ansible_dir

-- add export to ansible_dir for desktop users


Setup ssh keys !!

Make things more ansible-y

    Create a variable containing things I will copy
        - Learn how to create a variable with 2 fields: src and dest

        - can the dest_dir be {{home_dir}} in the vars file ?
            ie: can vars be based on other vars?
