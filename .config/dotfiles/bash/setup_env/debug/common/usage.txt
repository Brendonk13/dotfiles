at the very beginning after checking whether or not this is an interactive shell:
    source ../colors/8-16_compat.sh > /dev/null
    source ./func_call_err.sh


last line of bashrc:
    __cleanup_env_of_COLORs


What am I ever going to do with debug_dependencies.sh ...
    - it seems pretty useless if your installing files via ansible
    - just a headache to maintain lists per dir that the script can read from to check if we have all the deps

    - maybe I could turn it into a more general list partitioner
        - that's what it does currently at its basis anyways
        - can extend to any # of splitting criteria
        - which means its just the py function: filter(cond, item(s))

        - each condition could be given a name and we have created a condition hash-table


TODO:
    port over existing error messages
    each folder has a setup script
        this script first reads from each directories listed dependencies and checks if we have all of them
    add different colors based on support for the colors
