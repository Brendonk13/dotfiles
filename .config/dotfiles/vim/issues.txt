Need to make seperate minimal, common, etc for plugins
and do all of those before minimal even !!

-- colors for quickscope are wrong !!!


how to find which file bad:
    add desired lines before and after each source in vimrc.vim
    - test when it stops working

big issue with where syntax on needs to go
-- also why behavior change affftter sourcing vimrc within vim

fixed with :doautocmd Syntax



idea: add vimrc directory to extra dirs/files in ansible
-- so vimrc dir not in minimal file
and source them seperately before all plugins

Note: minimal file sourced last so plugins dont overwrite my shit

Note: MUST set quickscope befoooore you set colorscheme
