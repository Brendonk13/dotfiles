Problems:
    - what to do with files in new_dotfiles/bash/templates ?
        - probably change them to .j2 files and makeup variable names per file

    - need to change all dotBashDir declarations to be templated....


Variables:
    - dotfiles_root
        - some files copied here
        - used to create directories: sourced, not_portable, programs, setup_env, (templates?)
    - bash_dotfiles_role
        - defined in inventory per host

Copied Files:
    Need to generate a copy_files_task.yml:
        Loop over each line in newly generated files.txt
        Ansible passes "{{dotBashDir}}" to script which does sed to make another DEST_file with new prefix path
    1. Create script which outputs all files per role to ansible/bash/roles/$ROLE/files/SOURCE_file_list.txt
        - maybe then use sed to create ansible/bash/roles/$ROLE/files/DESTINATION_file_list.txt

    2. - then how to loop over the list copying the files  ??

    3.    - also need to remove the absolute path part
            - create script with args: old_path, new_path
                - calls 'sed' function to change the path
                - ansible passes dotfiles_root as the old 
            - can add "abs_path" flag to main.sh
            - then only use this for generating ansible file.txt
            - then have diff function to prepend each file in file.txt with the new abs_path
    - bashrc.sh
    - concat_roles.sh


Apt/pacman config:
    dont auto-generate this, not structured enough


Change main.sh to have a "out_name" input argument
- ansible will set this out_name to 



all current servers:

- rpi-store
    - common config

- proxmox
    - pihole
        - needs common config (and some hardening <-- diff playbook)
    - prom
        - needs common config (and some hardening <-- diff playbook)
    - test-vlan
        - test diff configs

- VPS
    - probably common config or dev one maybe


Additional playbooks:
    polybar
    harden ssh etc
    nextcloud stack
    prom
    media server stack
    setup keyboard config
    background images (and install nitrogen)




1. setup inventory and verify ping works
    $ ansible all -i /path/to/hosts  -u username -m ping
2. gather facts for fun :)
    $ ansible all -i /path/to/hosts  -u username -m setup

test with minimal config first
