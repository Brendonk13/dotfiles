up [count] to move up dir's

conda:
remc envName
newc envName

need to add shit to my bare repo can do this with config add .vimrc, config commit -m .. 

whole point of me trying to combine ag and fzf was so that fzf could use ag to find files 

    honestly whole point of that was to replace helpgrep with popup quickfix window
        but don't matter now that I know the :cw command luhl, will remove ag and add ripgrep with ALE oneday
    but now I have the benefit of fzf ignoring ~/FromInternet by default!!
